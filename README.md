# Heart Disease Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and builds a machine learning model to classify heart disease using the **Heart Disease Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The goal is to analyze the dataset, perform feature engineering, and train a predictive model to classify patients as having heart disease or not.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple attributes related to patient health, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The target variable indicates the presence of heart disease.

## Workflow
The project follows the following key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the dataset structure
   - Handling missing values
   - Data visualization and correlation analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Feature selection
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalization/standardization

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Splitting data into training and test sets
   - Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Optimizing model parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

5. **Testing & Final Evaluation**  
   - Testing the best-performing model on unseen data
   - Comparing different models to determine the best approach

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Run the notebook to explore the dataset and build the model.

## Results
The final model's performance is evaluated based on classification metrics, and the best model is selected based on its accuracy and generalization ability. Results and key insights from the analysis will be included in the notebook.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by improving the model, adding new techniques, or optimizing the workflow. Fork the repository and submit a pull request with your enhancements.
